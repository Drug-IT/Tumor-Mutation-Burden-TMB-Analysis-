# Tumor-Mutation-Burden-TMB-Analysis-
 Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) measures how many mutations exist in a tumorâ€™s DNA. Higher TMB can indicate that a patient might respond better to immunotherapy. This project analyze mutation data, annotate which mutations affect proteins, and calculate TMB by counting important mutations in protein-coding regions all using R.
